SECTION 1 (Maximum Marks: 12) 
• 
This section contains FOUR (04) questions. 
• 
Each question has FOUR options (A), (B), (C) and (D). ONLY ONE of these four options is the correct 
answer. 
• 
For each question, choose the option corresponding to the correct answer. 
• 
Answer to each question will be evaluated according to the following marking scheme: 
Full Marks           :  +3 If ONLY the correct option is chosen; 
      Zero Marks 
:    0 If none of the options is chosen (i.e. the question is unanswered); 
      Negative Marks  :  −1   In all other cases.

Q.2 
 A student appears for a quiz consisting of only true-false type questions and answers all the questions.  
The student knows the answers of some questions and guesses the answers for the remaining 
questions.  Whenever the student knows the answer of a question, he gives the correct answer.  
Assume that the probability of the student giving the correct answer for a question, given that he has 
guessed it, is 1 .
2
Also assume that the probability of the answer for a question being guessed, given 
that the student’s answer is correct, is 1 .

 SECTION 2 (Maximum Marks: 12) 
 
• 
This section contains THREE (03) questions.  
• 
Each question has FOUR options (A), (B), (C) and (D). ONE OR MORE THAN ONE of these four 
option(s) is(are) correct answer(s). 
• 
For each question, choose the option(s) corresponding to (all) the correct answer(s). 
• 
Answer to each question will be evaluated according to the following marking scheme: 
Full Marks 
:  +4 ONLY if (all) the correct option(s) is(are) chosen; 
Partial Marks     :   +3  If all the four options are correct but ONLY three options are chosen; 
Partial Marks     :   +2  If three or more options are correct but ONLY two options are chosen, both of 
which are correct; 
Partial Marks     :    +1  If two or more options are correct but ONLY one option is chosen and it is a 
correct option; 
Zero Marks 
:      0 If none of the options is chosen (i.e. the question is unanswered); 
Negative Marks :   −2 In all other cases. 
• 
For example, in a question, if (A), (B) and (D) are the ONLY three options corresponding to correct 
answers, then  
choosing ONLY (A), (B) and (D) will get +4 marks;  
choosing ONLY (A) and (B) will get +2 marks;  
choosing ONLY (A) and (D) will get +2 marks; 
choosing ONLY (B) and (D) will get +2 marks; 
choosing ONLY (A) will get +1 mark; 
choosing ONLY (B) will get +1 mark; 
choosing ONLY (D) will get +1 mark;  
choosing no option (i.e. the question is unanswered) will get 0 marks; and  
       choosing any other combination of options will get −2 marks.

This section contains THREE (03) questions.  
• 
Each question has FOUR options (A), (B), (C) and (D). ONE OR MORE THAN ONE of these four option(s) 
is(are) correct answer(s). 
• 
For each question, choose the option(s) corresponding to (all) the correct answer(s). 
• 
Answer to each question will be evaluated according to the following marking scheme: 
Full Marks 
:  +4 ONLY if (all) the correct option(s) is(are) chosen; 
Partial Marks     :   +3  If all the four options are correct but ONLY three options are chosen; 
Partial Marks     :   +2  If three or more options are correct but ONLY two options are chosen, both of 
which are correct; 
Partial Marks     :    +1  If two or more options are correct but ONLY one option is chosen and it is a 
correct option; 
Zero Marks 
:      0 If none of the options is chosen (i.e. the question is unanswered); 
Negative Marks :   −2 In all other cases. 
• 
For example, in a question, if (A), (B) and (D) are the ONLY three options corresponding to correct 
answers, then  
choosing ONLY (A), (B) and (D) will get +4 marks;  
choosing ONLY (A) and (B) will get +2 marks;  
choosing ONLY (A) and (D) will get +2 marks; 
choosing ONLY (B) and (D) will get +2 marks; 
choosing ONLY (A) will get +1 mark; 
choosing ONLY (B) will get +1 mark; 
choosing ONLY (D) will get +1 mark;  
choosing no option (i.e. the question is unanswered) will get 0 marks; and  
       choosing any other combination of options will get −2 marks.
